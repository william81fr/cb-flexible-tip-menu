** Configurable tip menu **

This is a tip menu app for Chaturbate. Fill in your prices and their description, and the app will repeat them in the chat as notices for your viewers to see.

There are two levels of configuration: the settings in the standard Chaturbate admin panel to make the menu look how you want it to, and inside the source code to adjust the admin panel itself. All the options are described below.

Why not configure everything in the Chaturbate interface? One example is the number of items: if 99 menu items are too many for you, feel free to reduce that value in the code of the app: the admin panel will be shorter as a result.

One great feature is the ability to fill in the tip menu items as you think them up, and not worry about the order in which you write them or the specifics of what you write. Just put the amount first in the box, and the display format will be handled globally by the app. It's configurable too.
